The project involves a series of experiment meant to simulate the solar system using numerical differentiation, culminating in calculating the intial conditions to send a rocket from earth to mars.
The final report provides a detailed presentation of the project.
Watch the gif for an animation of the rocket going to mars
Each file can be run as is, and performs each experiment independently. 
The PlanetSystem class handles the simulation and the planet class represents individual planets.
Experiment 2, which involves finding the initial conditions to send a rocket to mars takes several minutes to finish.
