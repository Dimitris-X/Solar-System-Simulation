The project involves a series of experiment meant to simulate the solar system using numerical differentiation
Each file can be run as is to perfom an experiment independantly
The PlanetSystem class handles the simulation and the planet class represents individual planets.
Experiment 2, which involves finding the initial conditions to send a rocket to mars takes several minutes to finish.
